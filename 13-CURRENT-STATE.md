- short/vertical gestures are ignored
- horizontally scrollable article regions are protected

## Current unresolved verification item

The mobile swipe feature has been source-inspected.

A full browser/mobile interactive verification should still be treated as pending unless performed by a browser/sandbox-capable session.

## Current infrastructure direction

VPS remains the primary backend.

Render overflow/failover is a planned architecture and has a disabled-by-default monitoring foundation, but it should not be described as live traffic overflow until the secondary service and proxy routing are actually configured and verified.

## Current known security gaps

- VPS origin exposure
- need for firewall/origin restriction
- need for stronger centralized monitoring
- need for tested backups/recovery
- in-memory rate limiter only
- no claim of full penetration testing

## Context maintenance

When a future session changes any of these facts, update this file and the relevant detailed file.
